I'm going to use a series of probability arrays to make the probability of a given note given the other notes that will be played during its duration.

Each octave is 12 notes long. We currently have 3 of them.
Each tone has the same probability of coming up as the equivalent tone in another octave, accept the note we are talking about.
The same note should note be played by more than one instrument.

The probability will be generated from a normalized array, shifted by the value of the note in question.
The normalized probability array might go like this:

01 00
02 01
03 01
04 03
05 04
06 04
07 03
08 04
09 03
10 03
11 03
12 01
-- --
13 05
14 01
15 01
16 03
17 04
18 04
19 03
20 04
21 03
22 03
23 03
24 01
-- --
25 05
26 01
27 01
28 03
29 04
30 04
31 04
32 03
33 03
34 03
35 03
36 01

So, if this were bottom C, then this is the probability distribution.
If, though, it were second E, then the whole list would be rotated by 16.

Then, when more notes are playing at once the probability arrays are multiplied together item to item to form the probability matrix for the 'chord'.

To find which note to play, generate a number between 1 and the total of all probabilities.
Then, go through the list, subtracting the value at each point from the generated number.
Once this new value is less than or equal to 0, that note is the next to play.
